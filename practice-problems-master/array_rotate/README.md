# Array Rotation

This problem is to rotate a given array to the right by `n` steps.

For example:

Given `[1, 2, 3]` and `n = 1`, you should return `[3, 1, 2]`

Each step, the last element in the array is moved to the front of the array, and the rest are shifted right.

Another example:

Given `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 3`, you should return `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

## Questions for further understanding

1. What is the time complexity of your solution? How about space?
2. Can you do this in-place?

*Challenge:* There is an O(n) time / O(1) extra space solution.
